# ‚Åâ About
FIreray works with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), together with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), doing [Real Time](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) accept arrays.

- Always with news in production
- Frequently updated
- As optming as possible

# üü£ Installation

Open your project in Visual Studio or another IDE, open the terminal, and use:
```sh-session
npm i fireray
```
- Wait for the module to be set and that's it! Now you can use the **Firebase** with **Arrays**

# ‚ôª Usage

- `1.` Depending on whether you will use the **_[Fsdb](https://fsdb.tk)_** or the **_[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)_** ( Not both ) you can simplify the use of **FIreray** by using:
```js
FIreray.singleUse('fsdb')    
```

<div align="center"> or <br><br> </div>

```js
FIreray.singleUse('firebase')    
```
- - The use is also simple. Only be based on normal usage mode and use collected function.
```js
FIreray.use('get', async (func) => {
    const get = await func(db, 'directory')
    console.log(get)
})
```

- `2.` If you are going to use the 2, unfortunately you will always have to keep using the prefix `fs` or `fb`. See the example below:
- - Remembering that `fs` is for Fsdb and `fb` for Firebase!
```js
const db = fsdb.database();

await FIreray.fsSet(db, 'users', [ { user: 0, name: 'Lucas F. Sil' }, { user: 1, name: 'Ana C. Rod' }, { user: 2, name: 'Vitor G. Sil' }, { user: 3, name: 'Kau√£ J. San' } ])
const get = await FIreray.get(db, 'users');

console.log(get)
```
